## Overview

I've decided to study the fullstack roadmap from the bottom up. For this challenge, I'm focusing solely on SASS (SCSS). My main goals were the fundamentals of SASS while using nesting, mixins and variables. I adopted a component-based workflow by default, even though the challenge was straight forward.

This challenge was a great opportunity to apply what I've been learning. Next stop is Vanilla JavaScript!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View a complete recipe page featuring a table, ordered and unordered lists, and a description
